Name: Mayank Karnati

The total amount of time it took me to complete this lab was 8 hours. It also took a considerable amount of effort.

One problem I encountered was with dynamically allocating memory for the quotes and favorites array. I declared the arrays
within main(); however, I chose to allocate memory for them within a function. Initially, I passed the pointer in as a
parameter, and allocated memory to that pointer within the function. However, I would seg fault when I tried to access it outside. After a few iterations, I read that to minimize undefined behavior, I should initialize and allocate memory within
the function, and return the pointer. After implementing that strategy, the code worked. 

One bug that I had found using gdb was while inputting the quotes from stdin. For some reason, the program let me input one
less quote than the number I entered. To debug this, I ran gdb and set the breakpoint at the input_quote() function using
"break input_quote". Then, I printed out the values of variable x, which holds the getchar() value, using 
"print /c x". The first value that was printed out was the newline character '\n'. I figured that it must have been an input buffer, so I cleared it by using getchar() to discard that value.
