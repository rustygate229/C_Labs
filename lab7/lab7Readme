Name: Mayank Karnati

It took 10 hours to complete this lab, and it took quite a bit of effort.

I thought that this lab was a lot more challenging than any of the previous ones, 
and it took quite a bit of looking through notes to complete.

One bug I fixed with the help of gdb was with compute. For some reason, my code
was seg faulting, so I took to gdb. I set a breakpoint at compute, and as I was 
running through the code, I realized that my loop was running an extra time. 
Since at the end of the loop the address to the struct is increased by 40 bytes
to get to the next, it was trying to access a struct that doesn't exist.
I realized that I reused %rsi while diving, and %rsi contained the count variable 
which dictated how many times the loop ran. By using a different register, I was able
to fix the bug.
