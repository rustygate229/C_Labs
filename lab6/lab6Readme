THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 6.

Name: Mayank Karnati

It took me about 5 hours and a considerable amount of effort to complete this lab.

I thought that this lab wasn't that challenging by itself given all the slides and notes.
The lectures were extremely helpful to have while completing this lab. My biggest problems
were figuring out the syntax errors as sometimes the errors messages were not very helpful.
Other than that, the lab was very interesting.

I did not use gdb with my C program from lab2 or the C program file given for that lab. I mainly
used gdb to find bugs in my x86-64 programs. 

One of main bugs I encountered was with the getchar function in create_key. I kept generating the wrong
key, so I set a breakpoint at create_key and I watched the %rax register for the return value of getchar. The first 
getchar value returned 0x0a which was the newline character. This is when I figured
out that the newline char must be cleared from the input stream. 

I didn't necessarily have to jump between the C and x86-64 language programs to find bugs. I used my
C program as a reference to guide my x86-64 code. All of my bugs came from syntax errors and not logic errors.
